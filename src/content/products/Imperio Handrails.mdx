Imperio J Series is a featured product for Juliet Balcony glass railing system. This meticulously designed system is predominantly used for Juliet Balconies. Juliet Balconies are balconies that have window tracks at the edge of the window rendering no space for railing to be installed. In these circumstances, side mounted Imperio J Series is used with fixtures above and below the glass with only glass in between. This system is also post less railing. There are certain limitations to use of the system. It can only be used for small and straight windows.
